[00:12.01] Hey, clap your hands
[00:18.57] Raise your hands up
[00:28.07] 
[00:29.42] It's a big commotion like a scene from a war
[00:32.09] What do you wanna say?
[00:33.83] Go right ahead. You can say anything
[00:36.12] In this beat and sound
[00:47.12] 
[00:38.47] 怒号も憎悪も喝采も Give it to me and hear me sing
[00:42.89] 音の中で昇華してく I'll beat your heart

[00:48.20] Hey, clap your hands. I will take you all through the night
[00:52.81] 心の咆哮 聴かせて
[00:56.72] Hey, clap your hands. I will take you all through the night
[01:02.02] その全て 曝け出して
[01:07.02]

[01:16.69] Aren't you holding back?
[01:18.76] Don't be afraid. You can say anything
[01:20.97] Just set yourself free
[01:31.97]

[01:41.61] 
[01:32.97] Raise your hands up. I will rock you with my soul
[01:37.51] 想像より遠く 響かせ
[01:41.62] Raise your hands up. I will rock you with my soul
[01:46.24] 全部忘れ去ってしまえ
[01:51.24] 
[01:58.94] Can you believe in what I'm talking about?
[02:01.41] Can you believe in what I believe in now?
[02:03.55] Can you believe in what I'm talking about?
[02:05.98] I'll make you believe!
[02:16.98] 
[02:08.33] 怒号も憎悪も喝采も Give it to me and hear me sing
[02:12.36] 音の中で昇華してく I'll beat your heart
[02:27.36]

[02:31.36] その全て 曝け出して
[02:36.36]
